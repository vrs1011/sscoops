	<h3>History</h3>
	<p>Sustainable Scoops, commonly known as "S-Scoop",
	started as a local Ice Cream shop in
	2012. It began when owner and founder, Victoria Saidel, learned
	how to make homemade ice-cream. She crafted the perfect recipe
	and wanted to share it with the world. Due to S-Scoop's popular,
	farm fresh ice cream, multiple locations
	around New Hampshire have blossomed in recent years. In 2015,
	a new location opened in Durham, New Hampshire. In 2020, another
	location opened in Hampton, NH. S-Scoop's plans to continue it's
	expansion within the next five years.</p>
	<h3>Why Use Us</h3>
	<p>There are many reasons why to choose Sustainable Scoops as your
	 “go to” ice cream shop. S-Scoops strives to remain eco-friendly and 
	in line with UN Sustainable Development Goal #12: Ensure Sustainable 
	Consumption and Production Patterns. All of our cups, straws, napkins, 
	and packaging is 100% biodegradable. Not only that, S-Scoops also ensures 
	all products come from local, sustainable farms. Inside each of our locations 
	you’ll find the names of which local farms are supplying what ingredients! 
	Additionally, all ice cream sold by S-Scoops is homemade and packaged/scooped 
	daily. You wont find cooler ice cream anywhere else! </p>
